# Start Here
The job finding process is generally a long and overall not-fun process for most. It is a 
realm in which fuzzy, hazy words rule conversations and one must figure out certain 
obstacles to hurdle to even show that you belong and get to next stages. But fear not!
Understanding and a bit of hard work can go a long way in the process. 

So you have found yourself in this process one way or another. Don't just get sucked into the 
routine of lightly update resume that you haven't really touched in years and then send it 
off to 32 applications and hope for the best. Let's set ourselved up to go into this process
and walk away with a job that we can be happy about. 

The first thing that I always like to address when talking to somebody who is just starting this
is asking them if they have properly "buzzed" their experience. What I mean by this is listing out 
what you have done, looking up all the cool buzz words for that, and then from that build out
a resume. In my experience, it is pretty common for somebody to be working on something, not have 
a word for it, and then that experience just gets lost in the vague space of "I promise I did work
for like 4 years." I have done it a lot myself. Two quick personal examples: event-driven distributed
architecture or multi-tenant application design. These two things were things I did but in the moment
I had literally zero idea that I was doing it. I can remember answering to a recruiter a no for these 
questions until I sat down with a friend to figure out how to resume better and had my "OH SHIT!" moment.

That is why I like to have people start with a listing out their experience. Just lay it out there. Then, 
see if going through that gets you any buzz words. Run that list by somebody else in the tech sphere. Do
they think of any buzz words? It is partially about playing the game, but also just about marketing yourself.
The buzz words are effective at shortening a concept to fewer words. Like caveman. Few big words.
