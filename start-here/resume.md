# Resume
There are a million different approaches to resumes. This project is not going to dive into selecting which one is for you.
However, I do think that there are some key thoughts and tips that I do want to pass along.

## XYZ Formatting
This has ballooned into a concept that everybody talking about resumes on LinkedIn has started saying - Google's XYZ resume. The key
part of this is the formula for writing out the bullets in your resume effectively - “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z].”
[Here](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/videos/google-resume-tips-and-advice/) is a quick video on it. The main focus here
is providing some data to measure the impact that you did. Get close on the numbers you provide and be ready to speak about it. Remember that
numbers here can be things like "eliminated errors" or similar marks of completely getting rid of or adding something.

#### Example:
- Rebuilt observability dashboards in web application achieving average load time reduction from 89.56 seconds to 0.24
seconds by implementing caching and optimizing queries.

## If you can't confidently speak to it, do not put it down
Remember that those reading your resume are not just the recruiter and hiring manager. Engineers and those that you could potentially work
with will be going through your resume as they interview you. So putting key words that you may have talked about in your previous role but 
do not understand to a level that you can adequately speak to may get you caught in an interview. Feel confident in what you put down.

This is a fine line though. See my [thoughts on imposter syndrome](/job-searching/imposterSyndrome.md) in this project. There is a difference 
in being an expert in something and having enough information to talk about something. Honesty in an interview goes a long way with this.

## Include per-role skills
Some of the best feedback I ever got from a recruiter was to make the first bullet within a role section on a resume a bold comma-separated list
of skills used on that job. This helps recruiters, hiring managers, and interviewers understand what you used and did on each role. I have 
also found it very useful whilst preparing for interviews, talking with recruiters, or just reviewing my resume what I did and used. Include
all that you used - even the stuff you rarely used - as long as you can speak to the experience.

#### Example:
> Software Dev at Tootleedoo Inc
> - **Skills: Go, Java, Postgres**
> - Some project I did....

## Update your resume regurlarly
Some years ago I came across this [blog post](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/17/career-narrative/) from Julia Evans. (As a quick aside, there is some great
posts from Julia across the years. A great follow. In particular and related to this project, the section on [career and work](https://jvns.ca/#career---work)).
I think utilizing a similar format is a good idea for every professional. Go back and look at your year and review it. Bring that to your resume. Update it.
As a goal, I like to try and do this every half year. Every year is what I would recommend for everyone.
