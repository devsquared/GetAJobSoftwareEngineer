# Experience Vomit

## Projects
- ***Here give a list of projects. Then dive into details. List out everything from tools and tech to your role.***

## Day-to-Day
- ***Separate by role. On a daily basis in each role, what did you do? How much did you contribute? What tools? What patterns?***

## Random
- ***If you have anything else you can think of, list here. This can range from open-source contributions to relevant personal projects.***
