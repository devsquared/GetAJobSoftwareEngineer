# Experience
List out everything that you can think of. Then, you have a bank to build a good resume. If your experience is related to what the
job is asking for in its description add it. 

## Projects
- ***Here give a list of projects both at work and outside of work. Then dive into details. List out everything from tools and tech to your role.***

## Day-to-Day
- ***Separate by role. On a daily basis in each role, what did you do? How much did you contribute? What tools? What patterns?***

## Random
- ***If you have anything else you can think of, list here. This can range from open-source contributions to relevant personal projects.***
