# Bullet Notes Worksheet
*Instructions: Fill out the bullet notes worksheet. If interviewing in person, make sure to print this out and have with you. In virtual
interviews, you can just have this doc open. The examples or instructions will be in italicized text: be sure to replace or remove that.
Also, I generally remove all white-space. This is a style choice to pack in as much info as possible. I like to try and fill an entire page.*
- *couple of notes to remind yourself like: calm down, breathe, think aloud, and check edge cases*
## *Job Tailored Answer to "Tell me about yourself"*
- *bulletize key points you want to cover in this answer*
- *tailor these to the job description*
- *example: description asks for AWS experience, highlight a project that touched AWS*
## *Tailored answer to "Why this job"*
- *Should have 3 main bullet points here:*
- *buy-in or interest to company goals or mission* *EXAMPLE: I have a passion for creating quick and efficient dashboards that provide quality business insights for businesses and users.*
- *express interest or why you would enjoy outlined responsibilities* *EXAMPLE: My interests and experience align strongly with utilizing Postgres and Go to ensure quick and efficient data ingestion.*
- *statement of how you see yourself succeeding in the role* *EXAMPLE: I work well in a fast-paced enviornment along with teammates and - with the strong overlap in my experience and skills - see 
myself making strong contributions quickly at ZCorp.*
## *Notes You Think you will need*
- *This section is a big catch all. The bullets here range from remembering concepts that may be asked to projects I want to link back to.*
- *Use this however you want.*
- *This section tends to take up most of my notes.*
- *If a recruiter or online resource has prepped me on how this interview will look, this section will be very tailored. Otherwise, it is quite hodge podge.*
- *A strategy I use is separating common sections with a header OR **highlighting** key words so I can glance to find them.*
- *Example: **Idempotency** is the ability to do some action any number of times and get the same result. Useful in APIs.*
- *Example: Bring up the being a **lead** for internal event-driven arch when talking about **Event-Driven** anything.*
## *Questions for Engineers*
- *ALWAYS prep questions. I always like to have 2 per type of interviewer.*
- *Easy to google some bases for this. But think about what you want answered. This is your chance. You need to know what you are getting into.*
## *Questions for HR/Directors/Managers*
- *These are generally more company, role, future, etc specific.*
- *I like to ask the company about things like "Where do you see this company in 2 years?" especially for smaller companies and startups. Can tailor to teams if need be at large place.*
