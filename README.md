# Get a Job as a Software Engineer (or relatively related role)
This repo was put together just after I got laid off. I needed some structure to get myself back on the
road to another job and back on my feet. I compiled a collection of notes from all kinds of places - some
are my creation, some are from random places on the web (I try my hardest to credit or link), and some are
a hodgepodge. 

I have created some worksheets as a means of guidance. You can utilize those to help you structure what you need
to do to market yourself and land your next spot. 

The goal of the repo is to help any person out there that just needs a bit of structure in their job searching 
and interview prep process. 

## How to Use
Use this repo in however you feel best suits you. Some recommendations are:
- fork the repo and make it your own
- download worksheets and templates to utilize locally
- just read and *thumbs up*

## Structure of the Repo
The repo will be separated by when you may need things - such as searching or interview prep. Make use of the 
resources whenever you need them.

## Contributions
I welcome contributions to help clean up the repo. Please see the contributions guidelines in CONTRIBUTIONS.md.
