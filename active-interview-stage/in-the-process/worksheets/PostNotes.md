# Post Interview Notes
*These post interview notes can prove very important throughout the process. I have found them useful to keep track 
of things that I have asked, answers that I have liked from previous interviewers, and notes about how I felt. Answers 
from previous interviews has proven quite helpful for me. Interviewers seem to like that you pay attention in previous 
interviews. So I often like to say something like "I really like how Tod answers my question about what makes a successful
engineer in this role." These are very free-form. Use them to inform your next interview prep.*

**Below are just examples**
- I felt this went fine. Maybe grade about an 80%.
- Really like how Tod answered my question about how the company chooses new technologies in the tech stack.
- They really seem to lean on company values. I should reference these during behavioral question answers I give.
