# Upcoming Interview Worksheet
- **Instructions:** *Fill out the answers to these questions or directives to begin preparing for interviews. This worksheet is 
helpful for all interviews but especially preliminary interviews and HR focused stuff. The **Guiding Questions** are the bank of ideas
and thoughts that will drive the framing of your interview answers. The **Common Questions** portion is a collection of questions that
are common in the process. Feel free to add other questions there that you feel are important or get a lot.*

## Guiding Questions
### 1. Bulletize the Job Description's Responsibility/What you will do section
#### *Create a bullet list of the responsibilities or expectations of you that the description is putting forth.*
- 
- 

### 2. Bulletize any tools or skills the Job Description highlights that the job uses or may want you to use.
#### *This can include things like the tech stack, personal skills, or anything else you find relevant to getting the job done.*
- 
- 

### 3. Note down any listed missions/goals of the company or traits they want in employees. Also go through the company website/blog for this too.
#### *What does the company do? What does the company aim to provide? What principles does the company have?*
- 
- 

### 4. Are there any projects or experience that you can think of related directly to the company or responsibilities that you want to make sure you cover?
#### *This is mostly a free-form answer portion but is important when crafting your answers.*
- 

## Common Questions
### From the above, craft your "*Why do you want to work here?*" answer.
#### Remember buy-in/interest to company goals/mission/principles (taken from question 3), interest or overlap in skills/responsibilities (combination of questions 1 and 2), and how you will succeed statement (largely from questions 1 and 2)
- ***Example:*** *I have a passion for creating quick and efficient dashboards that provide quality business insights for businesses and users. My interests and experience align strongly with utilizing 
Postgres and Go to ensure quick and efficient data ingestion. I work well in a fast-paced enviornment along with teammates and - with the strong overlap in my experience and skills - see 
myself making strong contributions quickly at ZCorp.*

### Craft your "*Tell me about yourself.*" with heavy input from the Guiding Questions portion above. 
#### You are interviewing for *this* job. So tell them about yourself with heavy bias towards what they are looking for. This isn't lying, but tailoring your experience and bubbling up the stuff that matters most. Structure this as **Intro**, **Past**, and **Future**.
**EXAMPLE:**
- I am a hard-working software engineer that utilizes critical thinking and flexibility to quickly and effectively dream, design, and develop software solutions. 
My experience includes years of delivering tested, quality software, numerous integrations, and implmentations spanning many patterns and architectures that lead to delivering solutions to 
users and clients.
- As a former software engineer at ZCorp, I had to design and develop quality and tested software quickly and effectively on an event-driven distributed microservice architecture. My
work here included becoming a lead resource for the company on our internal big crazy framework, reducing dashboard load times from 90 second timeouts to under a second load times, and eliminating 
ledger drift in our inventory management systems. I find this past experience has a strong overlap with that of this role's description.
- Given the responsibilities and skills outlined, I feel that this fit is a great opportunity for me to make contributions and continue to grow as a software engineer.

### "*Tell me about a time when...*" questions. This range from success stories to times when you struggled. 
#### The answers for these will come mostly from your experience and projects (question 4 above). You should though filter through these and find applications or similarities with all Guiding Questions.
