# Research Notes
*At the base level of a company directory of notes, create this file. Utilize this as a file that links out to any information that
you will potentially need during the process. For me this always contians a link to the company website, the company's career page,
and the job description if you can get those things. After this, I then append any extra notes that seem relevant. Sometimes that 
includes things like a listing of a company's values/principles or a theme that I am going for throughout the process.*
