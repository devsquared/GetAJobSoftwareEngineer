# Bullet Notes
You need to be able to quickly check and grok information during an interview. This should contain
anything that you think you need reminded of during an interview. Start building this process out early. 
The bulk of this sheet of notes will be the same interview to interview. You will need to change up some 
things. 

The bullet notes are your companion in the interview. I like to have this document ready to go whether a hard copy that I 
can mark on OR a doc open on my computer. Either way, this needs to be easy to access for you. 

On the note of transparency, I write this in a way that is personal to me BUT I am open and willing to share this with interviewers.
I started doing this because of the lovely problem that AI is creating where some have an open AI chatbot on one screen and feed it
throughout the interview for answers. To prove I am not doing that, I often make it clear at the beginning that I am checking my pre-prepped
notes in front of me or on this screen or that and I also offer to share the notes if wanted. 

Take the [bullet notes worksheet](./worksheets/bulletNotes.md) and fill it out.
