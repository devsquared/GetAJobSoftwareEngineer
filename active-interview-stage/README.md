# Active Interview Stage
First of all, congrats on making it into some interviews. This is part of the process that doesn't get enough praise.
Take a second to know that you have made it through a step in the process; some people do not. Now aim to make the most of
the opportunity. 

## Keys to success
Some key things to do in the active interview stage that can help:
- Make sure that you continue to track your opportunities.
- Take time to prepare for interviews - you may be surprised how much skimming a company's career page can tell you.
- Take notes throughout the process - especially before and after interviews.

## The structure of notes
You should structure your notes like below during this process. I generate these files as soon as I start the prep process for 
my next interview. I have all of these located in a local repository called "InterviewPrep". In my most recent experience trying
to find a job, this repo ballooned way out to hundreds of files. But even still I found this immensely helpful as I was able to
click into a directory keyed on a Company, catch up on notes and create a new prep directory for the next interview.
