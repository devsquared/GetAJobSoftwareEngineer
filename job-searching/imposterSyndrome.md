# Imposter Syndrome
Let's have a quick talk about imposter syndrome during the job finding process. This affects thing from the very beginning - searching - to 
the very end - offer negotiation and signing. It is also much more common than you may initially think.

Personally, I am someone who has had small bouts with imposter syndrome but I feel I am usually fairly good about identifying it in myself
and being able to move past it. During job searching, I realized how much it affected me and the mask it took on to hide from me. It took
me a couple of recruiter calls and prelim interviews to realize what I was doing and how I was holding myself back when it came to getting
a job.

We all know that the job-finding process can be a bit brutal. Jobs and companies want specific experiences, certain levels of knowledge, and
many other things to even allow you in the door. This to me was key to understand how I was allowing myself to hold myself back in this process.
The first phase of the interview process are resume checking and then some initial screening. Sometimes this happens with a recruiter; sometimes
with a hiring manager or HR manager at the company that is hiring. Either way, there are some bars set for the expectations needed to get in the
door. What I caught myself doing was a level of "I have some experience and am confident I could learn and apply myself quickly for this tool/skill".
But the initial phase isn't looking for this kind of response. They want to know if you cross some bar. So be confident here and allow the process to 
work as intended. If you have any experience in the given skill, write it down no matter how confident you feel you could rattle it off in the moment.
The further processes of the interview are designed to test this ability for you to know if it is at an ample place to get started in that role. 
Your goal in the first part of the interview process - both application and initial screening - is to get your foot in the door. Treat it as such. 

And you may yet ask, "well then how do you deal with the later phases?" To that I would answer with two key points - preparation and, more
importantly, honesty. 
- Preparation: If you know that this job - based off of the job description - is based around a certain skill, you can prep for that. Create basic notes in 
your interview bullet notes to help yourself with what you may see as basic questions around this topic.
- Honesty: In the later interview settings, you are often put in front of would-be (hopefully soon-to-be) teammates. This allows a place that you can be 
candid. You can say things like "While I do not have lots of experience designing, I do have experience implementing and integrating with..." or "I have experience
start to finish with a personal project, but professionally this is what I have...". The purpose of these interviews is to check if your skill level is what is needed.
Work with the system - no matter your thoughts about said system - to help you. I have also found that interviewers allowing me to be candid and talk fairly off-the-cuff
about a project or experience empowers me to feel strongly about that opportunity. It is a guage as well as questions are. If an interviewer is very
robotic and sounds like they ask a question and then quickly jot down notes and don't explore it with you, that is a flag to you about how working
there may be.

As an example, I found myself downplaying my experience with AWS a lot during the initial screenings. I even completely left it off my resume for a very 
long time. Reason was that if asked, I was worried I wasn't an expert enough to talk about it. I worried that if asked I couldn't build an entire system 
for an interviewer quickly. But the reality is that recruiters wanted me to list that down. I had years of experience with AWS - small projects, utilizing
S3 for small storage solutions, hosting a personal blog there, etc - that just was going unnoticed. And the important part is that this could get me through
the initial phase. I feel confident talking about my AWS experience in a room with other engineers. I know I am not an expert but I can talk about what I have
done. I can be candid.

As a closing thought, I think many people underestimate their ability and knowledge. When characterized and viewed in the right light, a lot of people are 
surpised about how far that will get them. The job-finding process is all about that - properly characterizing and putting yourself in the right light.
