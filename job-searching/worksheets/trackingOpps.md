# Tracking Opportunities
***Instructions:* This worksheet allows you to quickly copy and paste the format that I like using for
tracking all of the opportunities that I have open and active. To utilize, just copy the line down when you want
to add a new line. This can also be copied to a spreadsheet or csv file as it is csv. Feel free to add relevant info
as you feel fit.**
