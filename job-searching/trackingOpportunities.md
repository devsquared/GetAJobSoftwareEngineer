# Tracking Your Opportunities
It is valuable to provide yourself structure and organization whenever you are just 
applying and talking to many recruiters. Job searching can be very chaotic.

The [tracking opportunities worksheet](./worksheets/trackingOpps.md) contains the formatting
for how I like to track this information. I want to know the latest information on each role 
so that I know where I stand with each opportunity. This allows for me to cross check when I 
receive emails, check to see if I need to move on something, or much more. 

Of note: there will be lots of rejections in this list. That is the unfortunate reality of searching
for a job. That isn't you; that is this process.
