# Job Searching
Job searching is a grueling process - let's be real. You scour lists and lists of opportunities. 
You fire off many, many applications. You reach out to your network. You get back many rejections. 
Sometimes you hear nothing back. 

I found some level of structure and organization on my side helped me deal with the chaos that the 
job search was. In this section you will find a format I use for tracking the in-flight statuses of 
opportunities, thoughts on imposter syndrome, and more.

## Scratch notes
- do work early to be ready
    - you are going to get the same questions from recruiters many times
    - a lot of these questions have a lot overlap with initial HR sceenings and the first questions in interviews
- before really getting into the searching process, work on bulleting out your experience first
    - this allows you to address imposter syndrome or thoughts of "Am I qualified?" earlier than just when you hit a job description
