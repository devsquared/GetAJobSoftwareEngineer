# Job Searching
- do work early to be ready
    - you are going to get the same questions from recruiters many times
    - a lot of these questions have a lot overlap with initial HR sceenings and the first questions in interviews
- before really getting into the searching process, work on bulleting out your experience first
    - this allows you to address imposter syndrome or thoughts of "Am I qualified?" earlier than just when you hit a job description
